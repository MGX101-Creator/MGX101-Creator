 Hello World !

Networking usually involves meeting new people, who share a profession, industry, or interests. Networking involves exchanging ideas and information between these individuals.

Unrelated to computer networking, professional networking often takes place in informal settings. For example, networking can happen at events, your office, or through industry associations. However, it can also be done formally by connecting with specific individuals that you want to meet via email, LinkedIn, or other methods.

That said, if walking into a room full of strangers feels like your worst fear, youre not alone. Many people do their best to avoid networking altogether, but this attitude can be very detrimental to your success. Read on to learn what networking is, why its crucial for your career success, and how to network well.

Networking is important, but it doesnt have to be as intimidating as you think.
